## Simulation Studies

The folder contains .R files to replicate the results from the simulation studies reported in the paper:

* [ACML.R](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/blob/main/Simulation%20Studies/ACML.R). Contains the code to estimate the parameters using ascertainment corrected maximum likelihood

* [DatGenFunBiv.R](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/blob/main/Simulation%20Studies/DatGenFunBiv.R). Contains the code to 1) generate bivariate longitudinal data, and 2) identify informative subjects for a two-phase design under ODS and/or BDS design

* [FitImputeMI.R](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/blob/main/Simulation%20Studies/FitImputeMI.R). Contains the code necessary to run the multiple imputation approach

* [plotRE.R](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/blob/main/Simulation%20Studies/plotRE.R). Contains the code necessary to generate Figure 1 in the paper

* [Table 2](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies/Table%202). Contains the simulation setup used for Table 2 in the main paper (`setup.R`) as well as the R file (`runBiv.R`) needed to run all the code for different designs and inference procedures (ACML and MI)

* [Table 3](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies/Table%203). Contains the simulation setup used for Table 3 in the main paper (`setup.R`) as well as the R file (`runBiv.R`) needed to run all the code for different designs and inference procedures (ACML and MI)

* [Web Tables](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies/Web%20Tables). Contains the code to replicate the results from Web Tables 1-7.
