## Table 3

The folder contains the code to generate the results presented in Table 3. 
The simulation aims to show the validity and efficiency of the proposed inference procedures for secondary analysis of data collected in a previously conducted two-phase design with a single longitudinal outcome.

To run the simulation, load the scripts `ACML.R`, `DatGenFunBiv.R`and `FitImputeMI.R`reported [here](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies), load the `setup.R` script in this folder, and run the code in `runBiv.R` script in this folder.
