## Web Tables

The folder contains code to reproduce results from Web Tables 1 - 7.

* Web Table 1:  The folder contains the code to generate the results for Scenario (a) under an alternative specification of the variance-covariance matrix associated with the random effect. The simulation aims to show the validity of the multiple imputation approach under a different variance structure. To run the simulation load the scripts `ACML.R`, `DatGenFunBiv.R`and `FitImputeMI.R`reported [here](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies), load the `setupBiv.R` script in the **Web Table 1** folder, and run the code in `runBiv.R` script in the **Web Table 1** folder. 

* [Web Tables 2 & 3](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies/Web%20Tables/Web%20Tables%202%20%26%203): The folder contains the code to generate the results for Scenario (a) presented in Web Tables 2 & 3. The simulation aims to show the validity of the multiple imputation approach when we change the number of iterations used to generate the complete data. To run the simulation, for m = 5 iterations (Web Table 2) load the scripts `ACML.R`, `DatGenFunBiv.R`and `FitImputeMI.R`reported [here](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies), load the `setup5.R` script in the **Web Tables 2 & 3** folder, and run the code in `runBiv.R` script in the **Web Tables 2 & 3** folder. Similarly, to run the simulation, for m = 20 iterations (Web Table 3) load the scripts `ACML.R`, `DatGenFunBiv.R`and `FitImputeMI.R`reported here, load the `setup20.R` script in the **Web Tables 2 & 3** folder, and run the code in `runBiv.R` script in the **Web Tables 2 & 3** folder.

* Web Table 4: The folder contains the code to generate the results for Scenario (b) presented in Web Table 4. The simulation aims to show the validity and efficiency of the designs and inference procedures when we increase the correlation between the expensive exposure and the confounders. To run the simulation, load the scripts `ACML.R`, `DatGenFunBiv.R`and `FitImputeMI.R`reported [here](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies), load the `setupBiv.R` script in the **Web Table 4** folder, and run the code in `runBiv.R` script in the **Web Table 4** folder.

* Web Table 5: The folder contains the code to generate the results for Scenario (c) presented in Web Table 5. The simulation aims to show the validity and efficiency of the designs and inference procedures under a more extreme two-phase design. To run the simulation, load the scripts `ACML.R`, `DatGenFunBiv.R`and `FitImputeMI.R`reported [here](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies), load the `setupBiv.R` script in the **Web Table 5** folder, and run the code in `runBiv.R` script in the **Web Table 5** folder.

* Web Table 6: The folder contains the code to generate the results for Scenario (d) presented in Web Table 5. The simulation aims to show the validity and efficiency of the designs and inference procedures when we increased the correlation between the outcome and the confounders. To run the simulation, load the scripts `ACML.R`, `DatGenFunBiv.R`and `FitImputeMI.R`reported [here](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies), load the `setupBiv.R` script in the **Web Table 6** folder, and run the code in `runBiv.R` script in the **Web Table 6** folder.
