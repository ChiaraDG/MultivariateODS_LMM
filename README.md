# Two-Phase Studies with Multivariate Longitudinal Data

The R scripts in this repository contain the code necessary to reproduce simulations and data analysis of the manuscript "Two-Phase Studies with Multivariate Longitudinal Data" (Di Gravio, Tao, Schildcrout). The repository contains two folder:

* [Simulation Studies](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies): contains the code necessary to replicate the simulations in the paper

* [LHS](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/MultivariateODS_LMM/tree/main/LHS): contains the code necessary to replicate the LHS analysis

More detailed instruction on how to reproduce the results are provided in each folder
